  caveats <<~EOS
    QmouseFix is signed with a local (non-notarized) certificate, so Gatekeeper
    quarantines it on first launch. Clear the quarantine flag once after install:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/QmouseFix.app

    Then grant Accessibility access so it can read mouse input:
      System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility → enable QmouseFix.
