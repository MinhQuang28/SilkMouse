/// Hold a mouse button and drag to drive Spaces/Mission Control like the trackpad gesture:
///   • horizontal drag → switch Spaces (one jump per `threshold` px, paced by a cooldown)
///   • vertical drag   → up = Mission Control, down = App Exposé
/// The active axis is locked at the start of each drag so a swipe never does both.
///
/// Click-vs-drag: the same button can ALSO carry a normal remap. A quick click (no real drag) is
/// reported back to the engine so it fires the button's mapped action; a click-and-drag does the
/// gesture instead. So one button can be e.g. Mission Control on click, switch Spaces on drag.
///
/// Switching is driven through the Symbolic-HotKey SPI (`SystemActions`), so it works even if the
/// user disabled the system Space-switch keyboard shortcut. macOS 26+ blocks synthetic dock-swipe
/// gestures in WindowServer, so discrete jumps (not follow-finger) are the supported behaviour —
/// the same conclusion Mac Mouse Fix reached. A fast flick on release fires one extra jump for the
/// momentum feel of the real gesture.
///
/// State here is touched only on the event-tap thread; the public knobs are set from the same
/// thread at the top of each callback, so no locking is needed.
