/// Trackpad-like momentum scrolling with Mac-Mouse-Fix-style acceleration.
///
/// Each wheel notch adds an impulse to a velocity (pixels/second) that decays exponentially; every
/// frame emits `velocity × elapsed-time` pixels. Two accelerators shape each tick's impulse (re-derived
/// in Swift, not copied from MMF):
///   • tick-speed acceleration — faster consecutive ticks → bigger impulse.
///   • consecutive-tick speedup — a sustained scroll grows impulses exponentially after a few ticks.
/// (Both are disabled in the current "light" profile, see the tuning block.) A direction reversal
/// drops the old velocity immediately so flipping direction is crisp.
///
/// Smoothness comes from two choices that kill the judder of a naive timer loop:
///   • the glide is paced by a `CADisplayLink`, so frames land exactly on the display's refresh (no
///     `Thread.sleep` jitter, and never more events than the screen can show). When idle the link is
///     paused — zero CPU — instead of being torn down and recreated.
///   • each frame carries its precise sub-pixel delta in the fixed-point field, so slow scrolls don't
///     visibly step between whole pixels.
///
/// The link lives on its own thread+run-loop so it never competes with the event tap. Shared velocity
/// state is guarded by `lock`; `NSObject` base is only needed for the display-link target selector.
